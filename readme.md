## Debloating (Disable Stock Apps)
Use ADB to list apps you cant disable on device.
Example:
```bash
adb shell pm list packages
```
** DO NOT REMOVE CORE ANDROID APPS LIKE SYSTEM UI OR YOU WILL NEED TO REFLASH **


Use ADB to disable stock apps for a cleaner experience.  
Example:
```bash
adb shell pm disable-user --user 0 com.android.calendar
```
Repeat for other unnecessary apps.

## AI Assistant Emulation & Scroll Wheel Setup

1. **Install Button Mapper** [From the google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.homebutton&hl=en_GB)  
2. Bind **Volume Up** to "Scroll Up"
3. Bind **Volume Down** to "Scroll Down"

This allows the scroll wheel to work for page scrolling.

### Set AI Assistant Trigger:
- Go to `Settings > Apps > Default Apps > Assistant > Set assistant of choice (in my case Gemini)`
- Go to: `Settings > System > Gestures > Power Menu`
- Set **Hold Power Button** to launch **Gemini** (or assistant of your choice)

This emulates the Rabbit R1's AI button.

### How to power off
